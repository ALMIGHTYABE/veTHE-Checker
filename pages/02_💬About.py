    """## What is veTHE?
veTHE is 'THE' locked for voting power.

## What is the utility of veTHE?
- Protocol revenue access: veTHE holders can vote for gauges on a weekly basis, and access 80% of the trading fees (later 90%) and 100% of the bribes for the associated pool. 
- Governance participation: veTHE holders can partake in governance and cast votes for the protocol improvement proposals.

## What do veTHE voters receive?
- Trading fees generated by the pool(s) they vote for
- Bribes deposited for the pools they vote for
- Weekly veTHE distribution (rebase)

## Why this Tracker?
This was created by me aka üçìALMIGHTY ABEüçì to fill the gap of NFT marketplaces not showcasing Financial NFTs properly and making veTHE metadata user-friendly.
